# The Compression Puzzle

![GitHub Actions Status](https://github.com/otobrglez/compression-puzzle/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

One lovely Friday we were faced with this nice yet intriguing programming puzzle.

```
One shall write a program that compresses string "AAABBAAC" to its compressed form "3A2B2A1C".
```

These attempts were made,...

## Development

```bash
$ nix-shell shell.nix
$ make
```

To run individual languages use:

```bash
make python
make javascript
make scala
```
